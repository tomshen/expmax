# Expectation Maximization for Geographical Data

An implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm for a mixture of 
gaussians, designed to organize geographical data into clusters.

## To Do
* Heuristic for identification of number of clusters
    * exploratory EM -- introduce new cluster groupings on-the-fly
* Testing on real-world data
